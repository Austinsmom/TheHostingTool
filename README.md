# Installation
Visit /install to get started. We think this is pretty simple, but just in case:

# Upgrading
The latest version of THT can only be upgraded on top of the release directly before it.

# Getting Help
We have our own IRC channel, #tht on freenode. It rarely gets used but try popping in
there once and see if anybody is around. The best way to get support is by posting on
our forums. Please refrain from emailing team members with THT related support
questions as they are best handled on the forum. We also have another #THT IRC
channel on irc.expertec.co.uk
